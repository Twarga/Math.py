## **Project: Distance and Slope Calculator**

### **Objective:**
Create a tool to calculate the distance between two points and find the slope of the line connecting them, given their coordinates.

### **Tasks:**

1. **Input Coordinates and Calculate Distance**

   - **Description:** Create a function that takes the coordinates of two points as input and calculates the distance between them using the distance formula.
   - **Distance Formula:**
     $$
     d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
     $$
   - **Steps:**
     1. Prompt the user to enter the coordinates of the first point \((x_1, y_1)\).
     2. Prompt the user to enter the coordinates of the second point \((x_2, y_2)\).
     3. Use the distance formula to compute the distance.
     4. Output the distance between the two points.

2. **Input Coordinates and Find the Slope**

   - **Description:** Create a function that takes the coordinates of two points as input and calculates the slope of the line connecting them.
   - **Slope Formula:**
     $$
     m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
     $$
   - **Steps:**
     1. Prompt the user to enter the coordinates of the first point \((x_1, y_1)\).
     2. Prompt the user to enter the coordinates of the second point \((x_2, y_2)\).
     3. Use the slope formula to compute the slope.
     4. Output the slope of the line.

### **Examples:**

1. **Example for Distance Calculation:**
   - **Input:**
     - Point A: \((2, 3)\)
     - Point B: \((5, 7)\)
   - **Output:**
     $$
     \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
     $$

2. **Example for Slope Calculation:**
   - **Input:**
     - Point C: \((4, 2)\)
     - Point D: \((7, 8)\)
   - **Output:**
     $$
     \text{Slope} = \frac{8 - 2}{7 - 4} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
     $$

### **Requirements:**
- The tool should handle both positive and negative coordinates.
- Ensure that the program checks for a division by zero in the slope calculation (i.e., when \(x_1 = x_2\)).

### **Deliverables:**
- A functional script or program that performs both distance and slope calculations based on user input.
- A simple user interface or command-line prompts to enter the coordinates and display the results.
