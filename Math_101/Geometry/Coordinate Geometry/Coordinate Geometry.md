## **1. Distance Formula**

### **Concept:**
The distance formula calculates the straight-line distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) on a coordinate plane. It is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
$$

### **Example:**

To find the distance between the points \((3, 4)\) and \((7, 1)\):

$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (1 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

## **2. Slope of a Line**

### **Concept:**
The slope of a line measures its steepness or incline. Itâ€™s calculated as the change in the y-coordinate divided by the change in the x-coordinate between two points on the line.

$$
\text{Slope} (m) = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

### **Example:**

To find the slope of the line passing through \((2, 3)\) and \((5, 7)\):

$$
\text{Slope} = \frac{7 - 3}{5 - 2} = \frac{4}{3}
$$

## **3. Equation of a Line**

### **Concept:**
The equation of a line describes all the points that lie on the line. There are several forms:

- **Slope-Intercept Form:**

$$
y = mx + b
$$
Where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept.

- **Point-Slope Form:**

$$
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
$$
Where \(m\) is the slope and \((x_1, y_1)\) is a point on the line.

- **Standard Form:**

$$
Ax + By = C
$$
Where \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are constants.

### **Example:**

Given a slope \(m = 2\) and y-intercept \(b = -3\), the equation of the line is:

$$
y = 2x - 3
$$

## **4. Midpoint Formula**

### **Concept:**
The midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the segment into two equal parts.

$$
\text{Midpoint} = \left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right)
$$

### **Example:**

To find the midpoint between \((2, 3)\) and \((4, 7)\):

$$
\text{Midpoint} = \left(\frac{2 + 4}{2}, \frac{3 + 7}{2}\right) = (3, 5)
$$

## **5. Parallel and Perpendicular Lines**

### **Concept:**

- **Parallel Lines:** 
  - Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal: \(m_1 = m_2\).
  - Example: \(y = 2x + 3\) and \(y = 2x - 4\) are parallel.

- **Perpendicular Lines:**
  - Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is \(-1\): \(m_1 \times m_2 = -1\).
  - Alternatively, one slope is the negative reciprocal of the other: \(m_2 = -\frac{1}{m_1}\).
  - Example: If \(m_1 = 2\), then \(m_2\) for a perpendicular line would be \(-\frac{1}{2}\).
