Sure! Hereâ€™s a simplified and clear algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers:

### **Algorithm for GCD and LCM Finder**

#### **1. GCD Finder**

**Goal**: Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

**Steps**:

1. **Input**: Two positive integers, \(a\) and \(b\).
2. **Process**:
   - **Step 1**: If \(b\) is 0, then the GCD is \(a\). This is because any number divided by 0 is undefined, so the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.
   - **Step 2**: Otherwise, do the following:
     - Divide \(a\) by \(b\) and find the remainder. (Use the modulus operator `%` to get the remainder.)
     - Replace \(a\) with \(b\) and \(b\) with the remainder.
     - Repeat until the remainder is 0.
3. **Output**: When \(b\) is 0, the GCD is \(a\).

**Example**:
- **Input**: \(a = 48\), \(b = 18\)
- **Steps**:
  - Divide 48 by 18: Remainder is 12
  - Replace \(a = 18\), \(b = 12\)
  - Divide 18 by 12: Remainder is 6
  - Replace \(a = 12\), \(b = 6\)
  - Divide 12 by 6: Remainder is 0
  - \(b\) is 0, so GCD is \(a = 6\)
- **Output**: GCD = 6

#### **2. LCM Finder**

**Goal**: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

**Steps**:

1. **Input**: Two positive integers, \(a\) and \(b\).
2. **Process**:
   - **Step 1**: Find the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) (using the GCD Finder algorithm).
   - **Step 2**: Calculate the LCM using the formula:
     \[
     \text{LCM} = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
     \]
   - **Step 3**: The result is the LCM.
3. **Output**: The LCM of the two numbers.

**Example**:
- **Input**: \(a = 48\), \(b = 18\)
- **Steps**:
  - Find GCD: 6 (using the GCD Finder algorithm)
  - Calculate LCM:
    \[
    \text{LCM} = \frac{48 \times 18}{6} = 144
    \]
- **Output**: LCM = 144

### **Complete Algorithm Overview**

1. **Start**
2. **Input**: Read two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\)
3. **Find GCD**:
   - Apply the GCD Finder algorithm
4. **Find LCM**:
   - Use the formula with the previously calculated GCD
5. **Output**:
   - Print the GCD
   - Print the LCM
6. **End**

### **Python Code Implementation**

Here's the corresponding Python code to perform these operations:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

def main():
    # Input
    a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    # Calculate GCD
    result_gcd = gcd(a, b)
    print(f"GCD of {a} and {b} is {result_gcd}")
    
    # Calculate LCM
    result_lcm = lcm(a, b)
    print(f"LCM of {a} and {b} is {result_lcm}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **Summary**

- **GCD**: Find the largest number that divides both \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean Algorithm.
- **LCM**: Find the smallest number that both \(a\) and \(b\) divide into, calculated using the GCD.
